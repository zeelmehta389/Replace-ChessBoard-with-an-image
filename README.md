# Replace-ChessBoard-with-an-image
Replace the chessboard with the desired image using python and opencv.

This is a project based on python and openCV. 
Important tips:
      - Make sure that the size of the chessboard is given appropriate. If your chessboard is of size 8x8 then enter its value as 7x7 (one size smaller than original in length and         breadth both). this is line 32.
      - Make sure that the images you want to show is available in the same folder as this code. An array of these images will be formed. 
      - you can zoom in, zoom out the images using keyboard keys 'z' and 'o' respectively.
      - you can use keyboard to change the image. 'n' for next image and 'p' for previous image.
